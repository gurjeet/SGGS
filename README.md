# Sri Guru Granth Sahib

This project contains translation and transliteration of Sri Guru Granth Sahib.

## TODO

It seems that the upper-case character N in the transliteration lines is
supposed to represent tippee ੰ  (for eg. ਤੂੰ reads as tooN). Perhaps
use superscript to write these N characters so that it's clear that the word
tooN is not to be read as in 'cartoon'.
